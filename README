Registry Interface 2 Source Distribution
========================================

What's what?

* RegistryInterface2.html -- the document source code.  This is what you
  should be editing
* makeutyles.xslt -- the XSLT to generate utypes from VOResource input; there's
	a wrapper around this in the Makefile (this is included in the standard)
* RegistryInterface-1.0.xsd -- the small schema defining ri:Resource (this
	is included in the standard)
* VORegistry-1.0.xsd -- the schema for the registry extension describing
	registries (this is included in the standard)
* RegistryInterface2-fmt.html -- the formatted document.  This will be
  overwritten, so DO NOT edit this.  To rebuild it, say "make" (provided
  you have the necessary dependencies, cf. below)
* Makefile -- document date, version, and status are defined in there.
	This may also need some adaptation if your build environment is
  not a Debian squeeze box; common targets are RegistryInterface2.pdf and
  package.
* check_examples.py -- runs the embedded examples and complains if
  the TAP server errors out or returns an empty response.  Not needed
  to build the document, see embeeded comments for details.
* gettables.sh, maketable.sh -- get tables embedded in RegistryInterface2.html
	from the TAP_SCHEMA.  You need to set TAP_ACCESS_URL for them to work,
	and you only need to do that if the RR schema has actually changed.


See the comment at the top of Makefile for instructions on how to set up
things so they should work.
